\section{Intro}

\begin{frame}{Agenda for today}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Big picture: What is ``coalescent theory''?
  \item Time to TMRCA
  \item Inferring population size
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Big picture}

  Nomenclature:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Coalescent theory is not a theory.
  \item It's a model for the probability of different histories
  \item ``the'' coalescent is a bit confusing. We're not inferring the
    actual history of common ancestry, just the probabilities
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

 \begin{frame}{An actual``picture''}

       \small
       \begin{itemize}
       \item Top panel is a Fisher-Wright instance, ordered so that lines
         don't cross.
       \item Haplotype is a sequence (we are diploids, each 
         contributing 2 haplotypes). But let's just think of each line as
         an individual, for now.
       \item We can find The Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) of
         \alert{sample} (dark purple). Who and when would the MRCA of the top two
         individuals be?
       \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Our sample $\neq$ even all {\em extant } descendants of the MRCA. What
    does this mean?
  \item Our sample $\neq$ all of the descendants of the MRCA. What
    does this mean?
  \item If we chose two descendants at random, would we always get
    same MRCA? 
  \end{itemize}

     \end{column}
   \end{columns}

\begin{frame}{Our first question: When was MRCA?}

  If we sample two individuals (today), how long ago was their MRCA?\\
  (Note: question is not ``who'')
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Our answer will in terms of the probability of MRCA being 1
    generation ago, 2 generations ago, etc.
  \item We'll assume Fisher-Wright (constant N, each gen randomly
    picks parents)
  \item The answer is surprisingly simple :)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Our answer (1)}
  Let's assume we have $N$ lines in Fisher-Wright (Note: I'm not using $2N$.)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The chance that two sampled people have same parent is $1/N$, right?
  \item Thus $P(T_{MRCA} = 1) = 1/N$.
  \item What is $P(T_{MRCA} = 2) = $?
  \item What is $P(T_{MRCA} = n) = $?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Our answer (2)}

  Let's go to continuous time (reasonable if pop is big and time scale
  is long).
  
  Hazard of coalescence = $c = 1/N$.
  Probability of coalescence at time $t$ = $\ell(t) h(t) = e^{-ct} c$

  What is expected time of coalescence? Think life expectancy.
  \pause
  $E(T_{MRCA})$ if two samples: $1/c = 1/(1/N) = N$
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{TMRCA}
  Let's simulate
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 1 time, without random seed, letting N = 40, ngen = 200, mu = 0
  \item Average over 100 FW simulations
  \item What is variance of outcome? Is it what we would expect from
    exponential?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Break}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mutation and inference of TMRCA and $N$}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Say mutations occur at a constant rate $\mu$ ($10^{-8}$?)
  \item Each year we would expect $\mu$ mutations, and over $T$ years we
    would expect $T\mu$ mutations.
  \item Say we observe that two people differ at $k$ sites of the
    genome.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item When was TMRCA?
    \item How big is the population?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mutation, continued}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When was TMRCA?
  \item How big is the population?
  \end{itemize}
  
  Picture ($\Lambda$)
  Tree length = $2T$
  Expected number of mutations:
  $$
  E(k) = E(2T\mu) = \bar{T} 2 \mu
  $$
  Since,
  $$
  \bar{T} = E(TMRCA) = N
  $$
  If we observe on average $\bar{k}$ mutations, then
  $$
  E(k) = N 2 \mu \rightarrow \hat{N} = {\bar{k} \over 2 \mu}
  $$ 
\end{frame}  


\begin{frame}{Inference of population size, simulation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We do FW with mutations
  \item Average pairwise differences
  \item Divide by $2\mu$ to get our estimate
  \item We can repeat a bunch of times and see average estimate
    converges to the truth
  \end{itemize}
  Break-out.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Break number 2}

\begin{frame}{Coalescence of a sample of $n$ individuals}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is covered on pages 42 and 43 of Gillespie
  \item We'll just do one quick example, accepting the result
  \end{itemize}

\section{Intro}

\begin{frame}{Agenda for today}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Coalesence when population size is changing
  \item Inference from MRCA times
  \item ($n > 2$ comparisons and relative branch lengths)
  \item Demo: Using real mtDNA to estimate population sizes. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Caveat: We're still using $N$ (not $2N$) as the number
    of haploids}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Last time}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We defined the coalescent as the stochastic process going
    back in time to common ancestors
  \item For constant population size, we proved that time to
    coalescence for a sample pair is exponential.
  \item We showed (math and simulation) that $E(T) = N$.
  \item We showed that we could estimate $N$ from observed mutations
    if we knew the mutation rate
  \item Last time was models, today mostly application to making
    inferences about the real history of human populations.
  \end{itemize}      
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Coalesence when population is changing}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Last time we said hazard of coalescence was $h = c = 1/N$.
  \item What is hazard of coalesence in one generation for two
    different populations: $N =
    1000$? $N = 2000$?
    \pause
  \item What if within the same population $N(t) = 1000$ and $N(t+1)
    = 2000$? (Hint: we still follow FW in allowing children to
    choose their parents.)
    \pause
  \item If the population size changes over time $N(t)$, then hazards
    of coalescence in will change too: $h(t) = 1/N(t)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A small simulation}
  <<size="tiny",fig.height = 3>>=
  N_recent = 5000 ## population last T_thresh years
  T_thresh = 1000
  N_ancient = 500 ## earlier population
  n = 1000 ## sampled individuals
  set.seed(0.4886)
  T1 <- rexp(n, rate = 1/N_recent) ## give everyone a chance to coalesce 
  T1[T1 > T_thresh] <- NA ## if they don't in 1st 1000 years, resample them
  n2 <- sum(is.na(T1))
  T2 <- T_thresh + rexp(n2, rate = 1/N_ancient) ## at ancient rate
  T.vec <- c(T1, T2)
  hist(T.vec, breaks = seq(0, 5000, 250))

  Q: How could we estimate population sizes from this histogram?
\end{frame}

  <<size="small",fig.height = 3>>=
  T.vec <- sort(T.vec)
  St = (n:1)/n
  par(mfrow = c(1,2))
  plot(T.vec, St); abline(v = T_thresh); plot(T.vec, log(St)); abline(v = T_thresh);
  @
  Q: How can we estimate hazards from this histogram?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Our approach}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Say we have $i$ pairs of haploids
  \item We then compute how many pairwise differences there are,
    but instead of computing $\bar{k}$, we keep the distributional
    information $k_i$.
  \item Each $k_i$ implies a $T_i$
  \item We then have a set of ``death times'' (coalescence times),
    can build a life table, estimate the hazards, and infer
    $N(t)$.
  \end{itemize}

  \alert{some pair} of them will coalesce.
